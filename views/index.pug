      //- xxx a(href=`${id}?side=${sideToShow}`)  Use the Pug `each` iterator to create a projet img, title and link in the markup for each of the projects you are showcasing.  
      
      //- Use a combination of interpolation and template literals as needed to dynamically generate the the routes in the href, as well as the img's src and the projects title.
